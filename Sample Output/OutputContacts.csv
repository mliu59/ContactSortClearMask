I am a supervisor of School Psychologists in a very large district with roughly 140 School Psychologists on staff.  Clear masks are going to be very important for my staff when conducting evaluations for students of all ages (Pre-K through 12 and adult students). I would appreciate information on the cost of bulk orders by each quantity that is offered since one-time use would require a significant need on our part. Additionally, we will need masks in children's sizes. Do you produce children's sizes? As a new school year approaches, we have to find safe solutions for working with students as soon as possible. If it is possible for a district to proceed with a bulk order, Clear Mask would have to become an approved vendor with Broward County schools through the Procurement process. This usually requires companies to work through the bidding process, but I would like to share any information you can provide with my supervisors. You can contact me via email or cell phone.

Dr. Geeslin, IN School for the Deaf, superintendent has been in contact with Executive Director Jeff Blavin, at American School for the Deaf.  He is advocating for The Clear Mask in IN as well. My understanding is that you are working to improve speech intelligibility, sanitizing methods that would allow for the mask to be used more than once, and producing a mask that will meet FDA standards.  My questions: will the sanitization methods be available to the consumer to use in their homes? What makes the mask approved for FDA standards?  Thank-you."

I am working with my friend Molly (who is hearing impaired) to sell curated collections of face masks online. It is important to her to include a transparent mask option for customers who are hearing impaired. We will intend to donate masks pursuant to a ""buy one get one"" model. If possible, we would like to include your product in our collection. However, we are just starting out and unable to purchase 10,000+ in our first order. Furthermore, I understand that you are on backorder and timing is up in the air. Could I connect with a ClearMask team member to discuss how we might work together? Thanks, Erick"

We see a market (here in Australia) for schools, early learning centres, childcare, etc. Essentially, anywhere people have interaction with children, as these children are at risk developmentally from missing out on seeing their caregivers face. Decades of research has shown faces are an important tool for learning, and missing out on this can reduce language and learning outcomes in children. With the 0-5 year range so critical for a child, even 6 months can have a detrimental effect.So a few questions:- would you sell to an Australian suppler?- what is the unit cost on 10,000?- what is the RRP per unit?- what is the minimum quantity you’d sell?- what would delivery timelines be?- what are payment terms?We currently operate a small educational poster business (https://wearesquared.com.au). We imagine setting up a stand-alone online store stocking the masks, and possibly other related items for our target customer.Thanks so much for your time,Lizzie Deller."

Therefore, I think they could be utilized in a situation where staff are required to wear a mask ( as all staff are now if they cannot maintain the social distance/spatial separation from the asymptomatic client) and not in situation where the client may be on additional precautions.I can appreciate the ASTM rating of 3 for fluid and flammability, which is great, however  there is no reference to bacterial filtration, particle filtration or breathability. Therefore I am not sure how functional they will be for staff to wear. Perhaps we could get some to trial ? or even validation of the bacterial filtration, particle filtration or breathability?"

In a planning conversation with my panel, we discovered your clear masks and thought that they would be wonderful, not only for deaf and hard of hearing people, but also for teachers of young children.  We know, for example, that ""healthy"" development requires, among other things, that children be able to see facial expressions of their adults, and that is not possible with regular masks.  I'm wondering if there is some way to provide some samples to teachers and and early childhood centers and schools, so that they might become one of your primary target groups, along with health care and essential workers.

This means helping to restore capacity to direct one's interaction with all elements of the environment, including and especially people. Blind people engage with sighted people from the general public more frequently than sighted people, because of the need for support, or to gather visual information. This is in addition to all the typical communication needs for exchanging goods, services, and companionship. While blind people can't see faces nor use direct eye contact, blind people must be more strategically conscious of how we use our facial expressions to direct our attention to others and engage attention from others. In short, we use our facial expression to catch, hold, and intensify what I call social engagement energy. It may sound a little far fetched, but it's absolutely fundamental and critical. Blind people world wide are now struggling with profound social isolation exacerbated notably by their own faces being cut off from view. In truth, blind people often struggle against characteristic social isolation to engage others on equal terms, and the necessary imposition of face masks has placed blind people world wide at a supreme social disadvantage. We'd love to engage in some kind of collaborative to make Clear Masks available to blind people everywhere, but particularly blind people who work in health, education, and other professional public settings. We'd certainly appreciate being included on your list of specific categories of people who would benefit from Clear Mask options. (If you Google my name, you'll find our work featured extensively throughout global media, including TED main stage, National Geographic, Forbes, The Smithsonian, Extensive TV and radio coverage, and hundreds of others.) I am a prolific public speaker and Ashoka Fellow for social change, and our work was referenced in the 2018 U.N. flagship Report on Disability and World Development. I'd appreciate further dialog with you about this. Thanks."

We are hoping that this set up would work and we could have the teachers use the clear masks. Hopefully we can try it, be successful, and be ready for school in September.Thank you. Take care,Michelle Greco"

I am also concerned for my disabled students who already struggle to accurately read facial and mood expression without masks. I know my school can’t afford to order boxes of 24 masks for $60, but I could pay myself for a box or two for my students. This would help me if the masks can be sanitized and reused by the same wearer (since it is not a medical setting and in theory students are not supposed to come to school if they are sick). If they are single use masks it would only get me through a few days. I couldn’t find on the website information about this."

I have been a Crossing Guard at Madison Elementary, Riverside, CA for three years.

I may be the only positive person that they come in contact with, so for their emotional well being, they need to see my face.  More importantly, however, and similar to medical professionals, my facial expressions and mannerisms need to be seen as I give directions for crossing the street.  This part is ""critical"" has motorists do not always pay attention and have put my children in dangerous situations in the past!

Every time our customer buys one lipstick, we give one back to charitable causes - like dignity not despair and refugee womxn. We are beauty with a voice, and at this time our community is finding it exceptionally difficult wearing a mask and silencing their voice. We read articles about your company and how hearing impaired individuals and children are depending on your masks to understand and communicate because of the window inside of them. Research shows that lipstick assists hearing impaired individuals in deciphering and understanding speech more effectively. We would love to find ways to collaborate with clearmask in donation!

Due to the pandemic, we have been required to wear masks at all times while at work. While this has been necessary for the safety and well-being of our employees and patients (as we have encountered at least two COVID-19 positive patients within the last couple weeks), I am concerned about a new coworker who will be joining our team on June 1st. We have known her for a few years now, but she has only recently revealed to me that she is completely deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other. During her interview, she asked HR if they would be ok with removing their masks so that she could read their lips and understand them better. She became a bit emotional when discussing this with me, admitting that she is very self-conscious about her disability, felt guilty for asking HR to remove their masks for her, and worried about how her new coworkers will perceive her, as the hospital she’s coming to us from was apparently not very patient and understanding with her. Learning that broke my heart for her; not only is she a wonderful person and hard worker, I strongly believe that everyone should feel comfortable, capable, and respected, regardless of the limitations they experience, and especially with something as vital as communication. I would like to purchase these ingenious masks for myself and my coworkers, so that when our new team member arrives, she will feel more comfortable, respected, and welcome. I only requested one box on this form, as that would be all I could afford if I bought them myself, but I am thinking about asking my coworkers if they’d be interested in pitching in so that everyone could get one. I believe this will benefit our patients as well, and promote inclusivity all-around. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!"

Would someone from your sales team please be able to give me a call when possible? I am inquiring about purchasing the masks for essential early childhood workers currently working in preschools across Boston. They need the clear masks to be able to teach 3-5 year olds word pronunciation and language. Many of the children attending the preschools speak language as a second language. It is therefore difficult for many students understand and learn English using the regular masks. Is it possible for the preschools to purchase the masks directly through you guys? Thank so much!

Unfortunately, the necessary six foot rule is an additional complication.. I do not need a mask for myself, but I have six clients. Fortunately, I have a small caseload.My guess is that you have been inundated with requests since the article was published about you.I hope you are adequately busy, but not overwhelmed.If there is any way you can help me, I will be very grateful and happy to contribute to your Go Fund Me page.If you cannot help me personally, then maybe you could send me a reference to a good web site or business that is reliable and trustworthy."

We know through research and our own work experience that non verbal cues truly matter while talking to someone who is hurting.  A smile can make a world of difference.  We are a group of 30 interviewers and as such am not sure how many masks we should order.  I have questions regrading how many times we should change a mask.  Our interviews vary and at times can be at least 2 hours or longer.  Please let me know if it's possible to add us to the list of essential business.

We are currently looking for a face mask that has the protective functions (as needed during our current pandemic) as well as visual access of the mouth region. We find your product to be a great candidate for our needs. However, leadership has expressed the following concerns regarding your product: 1. how volume and intelligibility of speech may or may not be impacted while wearing your mask. 2. When will you be accepting new orders and what would be the estimated delivery date? FYI: I searched online for videos that highlight speech through your Communicator Masks but I was not successful. Will it be possible to send us a sample or if that is not possible can you send us a video that highlights speech while wearing your product.

This condition has been under control for quite awhile until the mask was put in place. First off I am having trouble breathing but it has also caused my skin condition to flare really bad. I am currently working with my dermatologist to try and remedy this issue but the cause still remains the same, the mask! The material of the mask rubbing on my shin, air not escaping and causing moisture and bacteria are the main issues. I have tried three different types but there aren't any changes and I felt hopeless until I saw your mask. This would be life changing for me because I have to work to make money and wearing a mask is required. I can provide pictures of needed! Please consider me as a person whom could receive this mask.

This clinic is part of the UC Irvine Medical Center which has a universal masking policy.  Unfortunately, this presents significant challenges in working with our population of children who truly need to see a clinician's entire face in order to learn many targeted skills.  Children who have autism have deficits in reading the facial expressions and non-verbal cues of others.  With a mask on my face, this makes working on reading non-verbal cues next to impossible.  It is also very difficult to work on a child's articulation when they cannot see my mouth and how I am shaping my lips, jaw, and tongue to produce words.   A mask like the ClearMask would be invaluable to the work I do and the children I serve!!!"

All are hombound or in group homes at this time, and many are suffereing with self-abusive behaviors and other challenges as they deal with the loneliness and lack of service providers with the pandemic.  I am considered an essential service provider.     For many of them, agency funding deadlines are also dependent on the neuropsycholgoical assessments I do,  and I need to complete them in person wtih these families and their children.   The agencies involved are NOT changing their deadlines, which means that wtihouth my reports and supports, the actual moneys to them and their famiilies will be reduced.      Given the current financial crisis, this is what many of the state agencies are hoping to happen ( not by malintent) because of limited resources.    I want to ensure the most needy kids and adults get these services, and do this I need to work with them in their homes and residential communities to make sure these reports are submitted in time for the June 10 deadline.   ]I got testing to be approved to do this and am negative, and what I need now is a mask that is clear like yours in order for my non-verbal clients to be able to see my face because they can't always understand my words.      I would estimate needing masks for 10 to 15 sessions,  but am willing to purchase a box of 60 and distribute them to other essential workers if that is what I need to do to obtain them.   PLEASE contact me to discuss the possbility of a purchase. at 240-426-6475 or liz.psykids@outlook.com to discuss.   Any help you can provide to ensure my vulnerable clients get the supports they need will be most appreciated.   If I need to pay more money to do this, I would be willing to.  Thanks so much.

Her 87 yr old husband just had a stroke and is not in good condition. She has been completely dependent on him for making phone calls for doctor appointments, social appointments, basically everything. The neighborhood is trying to get her a telephone where she can read the text if she needs to call someone or if she gets a phone call. I'm trying to copy your design to make a mask that she can see through, but you've already invented one that works and looks safer than anything I could make. I've bought their groceries every week, since covid started. She calls and gives me her list, but she's the only one talking. I call her from the grocery store when I'm leaving and she meets me to get her groceries. Her husband's stroke was this week. She's so sad and alone. No visitors for her (she's in an independent care facility and has a 2 BR rancher in there) and he's in a hospital 45 mins away. She's not allowed in due to covid, but also-she doesn't drive. I live in a close-knit neighborhood that gets together 1x month for dinner to celebrate birthdays. This 87 yr old couple moved out of the neighborhood and into the independent care facility around the corner maybe 4 yrs ago, but are still involved with the monthly dinners. His stroke was a surprise to all of us. The clear masks would be a great help for us to be able to communicate with her when we can meet outside and the weather is warmer. Feel free to call me 215-723-4955 if you have questions. We actually only need 14 masks for each person to have one-if you have any partial boxes already open.  The couple's name is Charlie and Marie Pizza. What a wonderful design!"

When evaluating for autism, it's important that kids be able to see our face, to assess for how they respond to our facial expressions and other subtle social nuances. So, I had been wanting to find some clear masks for psychology. We were thinking these might be friendlier too for our toddlers and younger children we work with.We would greatly appreciate any assistance you can offer with accessing Clearmasks.Thank you,Cindy Czarnik-NeimeyerCatalpa Health, Appleton, WIcynthia.czarnikneimeyer@catalpahealth.org#920-750-3695"

Having social and communication delays, my clients have much difficulty with language and social interactions. Teaching them to communicate and to respond correctly to the speech of others is one of the primary focal points of treatment. Having my mouth covered by a mask where they cannot see my mouth movements is a great hindrance for the progress of these children, many of whom learn how to form words from carefully watching my mouth. In addition, the common issues of rigidity and routine which typically coincide with a diagnosis of Autism present themselves as a refusal to ""allow"" me to wear my mask in their presence as it obstructs their view of my face and may be visually intimidating. This also interferes with the therapeutic benefit of the evidence-based therapy that I provide these children. If it were possible for me to resolve these issues by having a clear mask to wear with them, my young clients would be provided with more opportunities to progress in their social and language skills.

I work in healthcare settings and am interested in pre-ordering your masks.  I’m also wondering why they are not FDA approved for settings where bodily fluids may be present.  Is it mainly due to the need of going through the hoops of getting approval and the time that will take?

As a speech therapist, we are so blessed to work with such amazing children. Many of our clients have conditions such as autism, down's syndrome, fluency disorders, articulation and language disorders, as well as, hearing impairments. Providing verbal and visual cues and modeling is a significant component of our treatment, unfortunately cloth, surgical masks, etc prevent our clients from seeing our mouths, facial movements, and other structures crucial for providing effective modeling and strategies. It saddens me that the masks often feel like a complete barrier. They impede on the quality of our overall interpersonal interactions with our clients, our ability to connect, and even our ability to give them a huge smile and ease their fears during this terrifying time. I was beyond excited and inspired when learning about The Clear Mask and finding the company online. I truly believe that the growing use of clear masks in medical and healthcare facilities will have a much profound, uplifting, and positive impact on so many. I know that resources are scarce. Is it possible to purchase a smaller box, so that the SLPs and other therapists can trial them with our clients at the clinic? Thank you so much for your time."

I'm a Deaf person working as an essential employee in a grocery store. I was interested in possibly ordering some of these masks for use by my co-workers in the store so I would be able to communicate more effectively with them. While the store does provide masks for all employees, they are the regular masks and they cover the mouth, so I can't lipread. It's both frustrating and isolating. HOWEVER. when I go to the part of your website that where people are providing feedback on the mask and endorsing it, and there are photos of people talking about the ClearMask and how good it is. And yet NONE of those photos show a person actually wearing the ClearMask. They are wearing masks, yes... but they are not the ClearMask. The only place I actually see the ClearMask is on the HomePage, where one individual is showing it off, and in your video, which is clearly a staged production. How am I supposed to believe that these people really like the ClearMask, if they don't even show themselves using it - even though they are being displayed in your website wearing a mask...a REGULAR mask? I'm sorry, but that feels like sending a hypocritical message: ""Oh yes, I think the ClearMask is a wonderful product, I'm just not wearing one in this photograph."" Hello??? If you're supposed to be endorsing the product and yet you're wearing a completely different kind of mask in the photo, then I am disinclined to believe the endorsement.

I am very concerned about how our patients will relate to us (PT, OT, SLP) when we are trying to work with them and they can't see our faces to try to determine what we are asking of them. Typical masks will also be very frightening, especially because our patients won't understand why they are necessary. Therefore, I am asking for 1 box for our clinic for us to try out. We have been shut down since the middle of March & are scheduled to reopen on Monday, May 4th for limited hours. Therefore I'm asking for you to send the masks to my home address to be sure I can get them. Thank you for your inovation and hard work.

Child Care Aware of America and the National Head Start Association are recommending child care providers refer to CCR&R agencies for PPE. I want to make sure we are an agency that is all inclusive. In working with the deaf, I am acutely aware that lip reading and facial expressions are key to communication. However, in Indiana it is recommended anyone over 2 years of age wear a mask whenever possible. Current Illinois mandates are anyone over 2 wear a face covering. People that are deaf and hard of hearing are not the only exception. Young children are often frightened when one's face is covered. Many providers are getting ready to re-open if they haven't already. Can you please consider child care workers as part of the first responder group? They often work without protective devices as they are often not thought of as a group. And, if they are in the same level of priority, would you please be so kind as to indicate so on your website?

Many of my clients do not have internet or do not want telehealth.  Communication is such a key part of what I do with my clients that I need to utilize clear masks to help them feel more comfortable and willing to come into session.  A few reasons I need the masks are that many of my clients that are hard of hearing rely on looking at lips, clients with trauma from being molested by a masked person, etc...  I am trying to make masks at home to see if I can create some that will help my clients. Then I saw your website.  I realize I am not a doctor but therapists are the silent front liners working with medical professionals that are having acute stress, people in our community that have anxiety and depression that are certainly triggered higher with the COVID19.  I have tried telehealth and will try to continue that service for my clients but I also have clients that need face to face.  I hope to hear that you are able to make these soon.  I am not asking for a lot.. just 2 to 4 boxes to at least get me started.  I am making enough to cover my expenses so I am not closing my doors yet but I know I need to get back in the office  for face to face sessions and provide the best I can for a safe environment.

Nest Strategies is a student-run marketing consulting organization at Johns Hopkins University. Nest provides various services to local businesses to enhance their marketing portfolios, while providing valuable experience to its members.As I’m sure you know, businesses across the country are struggling, and as a result, many Hopkins students are having a difficult time securing a summer 2020 internship. To solve these issues in this trying time, Nest Strategies has created Nest Network. The aim of this program is to match business-savvy Hopkins undergraduates who are willing to complete an unpaid internship (can be remote) with companies like you that may be in need of an intern this summer.The ask: We are reaching out to ask 1) if ClearMask would be interested in being matched with an unpaid intern from Johns Hopkins University and 2) if you could reply to this email telling us the business facets in which an intern could be of assistance.If you would like to speak further over the phone, please reply to this email with the best phone number to reach you and your availability to chat this week.The process, in brief:Step 1: Nest Strategies gathers the names and needs of businesses (like you!) interested in taking on one or multiple unpaid summer interns.Step 2: Nest Strategies publicizes to undergraduate students that there is a new internship-matching program.Step 3: Nest reviews all applications, conducts a preliminary phone screen with serious candidates, and matches the student to one of the businesses.Step 4: YOU have a phone call with the student(s) to ensure you would be comfortable with the intern working for you this summer.Step 5: You receive valuable assistance this summer! (minimum 40 hours of work total in order for the student to receive academic through Johns Hopkins)Thanks very much for reading and we hope to partner with you!Sincerely,Elizabeth Goldstone"

169151,Miriam,Schroeder MD,m.schroeder.md@gmail.com,"Miriam Schroeder, MD",Psychiatric Physician & Private Practice Owner,,Behavioral health (therapy & mental health),,Lead,Direct Buy,1,Pre-Order,,"You can look me up to verify I am who I say I am:  (practice website: www.miriamschroedermd.com)  (state database, search by name to verify my medical license: https://pr.mo.gov/licensee-search-division.asp)I am a Psychiatric Physician and continue to treat patients during this COVID-19 crisis.  I have primarily been having telehealth appointments, but for new patients I like to bring them into the office for their first appointment because you really just can't establish that same kind of connection via video, and this is so important in psychiatry.  However, I still have a dilemma when bringing those patients in to the office:  Go maskless & run the risk of coronavirus exposure vs. wear a mask, but that defeats a lot of the purpose of this in-person meeting.  It is important for patients to be able to see my whole face so they can judge my facial expressions and know whether they are being understood and ""heard"" on an emotional level.  I also work one afternoon per week as a Psychiatric Physician with a social services agency that works with the homeless - obviously these folks do not have access to remote video appointments and so they must also be seen in person.  In both of these situations, it would be nice if both the patient and myself could be wearing these kinds of masks to minimize exposure (it is also very important for me to be able to see their faces and facial expressions).  If these work out well for me, I might like to order a second case at some point (if possible), I would probably donate them to the social services agency I mentioned (St. Patrick Center https://stpatrickcenter.org/ ).  I am trying not to be ""greedy"" in my request because I know that there are folks who are even more on the ""front lines"" - working in hospitals with symptomatic patients.  I am not seeing any patients in person who exhibit symptoms that might indicate a Covid-19 infection, but since there seem to be a lot of asyptomatic carriers, I think wearing a mask is important.  Thank you for developing this terrific product - one of the first things I immediately thought of when it became apparent that wearing masks would become a widespread practice was ""Oh no, what will people who rely on lip-reading do?""  Thanks again for your consideration.  Miriam Schroeder, MD"

My mother, Shirley Van Hoover, will turn 90 on May 4, 2020. We are all on stay at home orders, so will not be able to visit with her. Her facility has strict lock-down and visitors may not enter. This is a birthday present for her - enough masks for everyone at her facility (residents and staff). Everyone in the facility must wear masks at all times when out of their apartments. Despite her hearing aids, she is severely hearing impaired and she has told me that she is suffering badly from not being able to read lips. Her already reduced social contact is being adversely impacted by the mask requirement and she is becoming lonely. As a birthday gift, I would like to enable her friends and care providers improved communications and enhanced community. I am asking for 3 boxes, but if that quantity is unavailable I would be happy with even one box. Thank you!"

I often meet deaf or hard of hearing clients onsite for their meetings, hospital visits, or other appointments.   I am also immuno suppressed and must always wear a mask when I go out. This makes it very difficult to communicate with my clients without them being able to see my mouth to lipread and I have had to curtail my services because of this. Your mask, with the clear piece to enable lip reading, would be a great solution to allow communication during this time. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to use your masks to be able to continue offering my captioning services."

I am the founder of CIAF and we help deaf people hear. We have two retail clothing stores (all new women's clothing) and the proceeds from the sales of the stores go back to CIAF to help deaf people hear. I am the owner/founder  and am deaf and hear via cochelar implants -- as do many of my staff. With COVID  19 -- we are required to wear face masks at all times upon reopening. This poses a huge problem bc most of us cannot hear or are very hearing impaired and the typical face masks block lip reading. Your help in allowing us to purchase masks for our staff and customers would be immensely appreciate - we need them to be operational at our retail stores in order to understand and serve our customers. Without  store sales, we would be forced  to close the foundation.  We would even be interested in being a wholesale account for your product. We have  a social medai following on FB of about 85k.

They pick their noses, blow spit into my mouth when coming up out of the water, sneeze, cough and booger drip all over!  When I write it I wonder why I do this.  I love them to learn to trust me with our eye to eye and expression reading faces and we are on the same eye level as well.  Even when the stay at home orders are lifted, private lessons do not let social distance be a part of the job.  I am not sure how this is going to go.  I thought I would try the clear mask idea to see if that helps parents and me feel comfortable.  I was planning to start lessons as soon as possible so could you let me know when you could send me some masks to try out to see how it works before I offer this idea to parents?  I will happily post on my instagram about you all if it works for me.  Thanks so much.  Feel free to call me.  1 mask with ear loop and one with tie on would be great to try and maybe a full face shield might work better...let me know."

We're a secure treatment facility operating under the State of MN Direct Care and Treatment division. We provide all clinical and health services treatment on-site as our clients are not allowed to leave our facility by law. We have a number of clients with hearing impairments, and as such we use translators when available, but we also rely on clients being able to read staff's lips for communication. With the current precautions our program has initiated, it's made it difficult for staff to communicate with the clients as a result of having to wear standard masks. Your product appears to fix that issue by being able to see an individual's mouth while wearing the mask. Is it possible for us to order on box of masks so that we may continue clinical and health services treatment for our clients during this pandemic? Thank you very much for your consideration and we appreciate your help during these difficult times. Steven Sturlaugson"

My 5 year old autistic son is non-verbal and with schools closed and most therapies moved to virtual the only essential medical service he is receiving is his ABA therapy that allows his therapists to come to our house Mon-Fri for 4 hours sessions. The ability to keep this therapy going with SIP in place has been our only saving grace for his progression. Unfortunately starting yesterday his therapist is required to wear a mask. The inability to see his therapists mouth is critical to encouraging him to speak and he relies so much on visual cues, verbal prompts and reading her face to get speech out of him. I’m blessed that he is not terrified of his therapist (any mask/hat/face paint has had him running for the hills) but unfortunately sessions are just not as effective and I fear he’ll regress further if things continue as is. Thank you and I'm sure his therapy provider will be eager to supply these for entire staff once you have inventory."

My husband is hearing impaired it's been hard for him already but worst during this pandemic since he relies on reading lips when in communication with his family and job. We have 3 young children and I'm sadden by so many face masks but not enough thought for the deaf or hearing impaired. They could be having an entire conversation with him and he would not know what's being said because he can't see mouth movements. His hearing aids are starting to become choppy because he has them on most of the time. So, if it's possible I would definitely pay for a box to see how well equip these are and he would love them. He would be able to communicate"

I am myself a little bit hearing impaired (left ear is no good).. I can still hear fine, but I think I rely on seeing people's mouths as part of the way I hear as good as I do... so this mask will be extremely valuable to people in general as time goes on and the COVID-19 virus is eventually controlled... people will continue to need to wear masks in public places for a good long time I expect.  I would appreciate getting some masks for our use here once the needs of hospitals are all met, but then later I would like to also offer your mask as a distributor.

Our caregivers are being asked to wear masks while caring for children; however, this poses a problem for infants, toddlers, children who are deaf or hard of hearing, and dual language learners because these children rely greatly on facial expressions and/or lip reading to communicate with their caregivers, many of whom will be strangers to them due to emergency child care arrangements. Additionally, the safety and security that caregiver-child relationships can provide are critical for children's adjustment and well-being, not just during a pandemic but always. Very young children are likely to be confused, anxious, or even fearful when faced with a new caregiver whose face is covered. The families and early childhood community of San Francisco would benefit greatly from your clear masks. Thank you!"

55351,Peter,Conry,peter@nutricentric.com,Nutricentric Healthcare,,Distributor,Healthcare,Yes,Subscriber,,,Contact Us,,"Hi, I'm a Community Pharmacist in Ireland (but am also involved in Medical Device distribution so I've some interest there too). However, my primary reason for asking is that GP practices are restricting patient visits. So this places a greater burden for primary care or triage-guidance on pharmacies. This puts pharmacy staff at elevated risk but, unlike medical/hospital staff who get PPE provided by the State, we've to do our own thing. Supplies are scarce and what there is is uncomfortable and difficult to recycle. So my first question is, is the Clearmask ok for use in such a setting. We need to restrict exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (8 pharmacy staff have died in Spain so far) but we don't face the risk of liquid exposure faced in hospitals. How good is the filtration capacity of the masks. Is it close to N95. The virus is airborne in droplets so pharmacy air is a hazard. I'd guess that Clearmask performs better than a normal surgical mask but the question is really about the filtration capacity. And the next question is, how do you clean the mask for re-use. Can it be steamed, sterilized in Chlorox diluted 1 in 10, or what would you suggest? Many thanks, Peter  P.S. Congrats on the good idea!!"

I really think this is an amazing idea. One of the things that has weighed heavily on my mind during this pandemic and the possibility that everyone may be required to wear masks out in public in the future...should this pandemic continues or any future ones pop up.  While visiting dentists/dental hygienists and communicating with my dad's amazing doctors and nurses when he fought cancer, I had a hard time understanding them and was uncomfortable asking them if they could remove their masks so I could read their lips. Masks are usually made out of color paper or some type of fiber material. I have been concerned about how I am going to communicate with customers, clients, friends, family, the community in general if we all are required to wear masks out in public. A local friend has been sewing fabric masks for hospitals and for community members. I asked her last week how and if could she make a clear one. She said that raincoat material might work. I thought it might fog up when people are breathing and told her that I'd keep looking researching for clear breathable materials. I am very interested in your product.

We have been struggling to get masks for our clinics, but even with wearing masks,  many of our patients need to read the provider or interpreter's lips to know what we're saying. That means either the provider has to take off their mask to communicate with the patient or the patient appointment time becomes much longer and more frustrating for the patient. We have roughly 150 people working in our clinics with patients, but the providers are the ones that have the most time with the patients. Help- we're looking for solutions like this everywhere."

I'm also a mental health clinician, licensed clinical social worker in a primary care clinic that is currently running a URI clinic in our community to offload our ER.  We carry a 17k patient panel.  I'm really struggling as the only mental health provider in our setting being able to ""hear"" both patients and the doctors I collaborate with using traditional masks since I rely primarily on lip reading and have most of my life.  Being only able to use my cochlear implants (which I did not get until I was 19 and 27) causes me to wear out from listening in about 2 ours and continually feel like I'm asking people to yell.  I really need a solution to help me get through our current situation.I was wondering how far out getting masks from your company is and how much yours are cost wise?  We wouldn't need them for our entire clinic, but enough for our doctors to communicate for me and for my patients that need them, so that I could understand them.  This would allow me to serve in the capacity that I'm used to and be much more effective in a time that I need to be when I'm already spread thin.Thank you for your time!Angie Lyon, LCSW, LIMHP"

On behalf of all sign language interpreters working in medical settings, I would like to thank you for finally creating a mask that helps us efficiently do our job!  It is so frustrating for our patients (and us too) to have to be in a doctor's office or hospital and still have to navigate the challenges of clear communication especially when they are feeling unwell.  Typical face masks are a barrier to receiving vital information that is provided through the visual language of ASL and the old fashioned mask can make the patient feel isolated, frustrated and afraid.  We were all wishing for something like this to be invented and finally it is here.  I would love to spread the news in our community to let everyone know CLEAR MASK is the answer we've all been waiting for.  Thanks so much for making it happen.I would also like to request the information about how much the masks cost, what quantities they come in and the differences of the ear loop and the tie-on models. When will they be available and on the market?  Is the only place we can purchase them on line or in stores and medical supply houses.? Will you be making them with totally clear pieces meaning without the white line across the nose area and chin area? Are the masks disposable or reusable?

In the last two weeks soon after the coronavirus outbreak started, I have been wondering how the sign interpreter friends I know can do their job while keeping themselves safe from the deadly virus. And I just saw one of my sign interpreter friends interpreting in a live broadcast of the press conference about the strike of HK's medics. It worries me when I see my friend interpreting with his face mask off (this is the norm among sign interpreters here). I've been searching for solutions and just come across your website. The Clear Mask is exactly the solution the sign interperters need in HK right now! I wonder if the Clear Masks are available (as I only see ""pre-order"")? Do you ship to HK?"

I am a registered nurse who also has cancer.   I am awaiting an upcoming stem cell transplant for bone marrow cancer.  I would love to have the mask to wear during the long recovery months.  I thinkthe idea of having your whole face visible while at the same rime providing much needed protection is wonderful.  Although the mask with ear loops would be my preference for ease......getting the best seal is most important. I would  like to try both to determine which one fits the bill the best.  Are they reusable??  I would like 10 of each....total 20

It requires me to always open my mask to demonstrate oral movements for my speech assessment and it doesn't really serve the purpose of wearing a mask especially when patient suddenly cough. It's not very respectful to cover our mouth suddenly just because the patient cough. On the other hand, some of my patient have language barrier especially, we live in a multiracial country where we have many languages used for different targeted population.
